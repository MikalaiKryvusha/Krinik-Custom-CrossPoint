# STATUS — Krinik Custom CrossPoint (KCCP)

Updated 2026-11-10 (chat closing). Licence: MIT (owner, 2026-11-08: «как у оригинального CP, или MIT»); fonts OFL, firmware images GPLv3.
 Moved off the owner's laptop, where it lived as a loose folder (`~/Xteink`) beside an unrelated
work project. From now on it is a standalone project.

## Where to continue

- **Chat 2026-11-09 20:30 → 2026-11-10 (CodeRabbit round 3, debug7/8, simulator PR #62) closed** — its full log moved
  verbatim to `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` (entry 2026-11-10). Result: #4377 books-card title fix pushed (`c9d69cbd`); #4376
  redraw-timer fix pushed (`94e1c3a2`) after the owner's reader check; debug7 (bugs 03/04) and debug8 (idea 01) PASS on
  the reader; native Windows simulator PR **#62** opened and its CodeRabbit round 1 fixed (`087cb54`).
- **First steps next chat:**
  1. `node D:/work/ai_sandbox/_tools/machine-lock.mjs status` and `ListAgents` — the PC is shared with KUMM and KAGO;
     during another agent's quiet window: no builds, no simulator, no GUI windows.
  2. Read reviews on simulator PR #62 (https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-simulator/pull/62) and on
     firmware PRs #4328 #4332 #4375 #4376 #4377:
     `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments --jq '.[]|select(.created_at>"<last read>")'`.
     PR #62 at 02:10 +03:00: head `087cb54`, mergeable; CodeRabbit round 1 — all 4 threads resolved, the outside-diff finding acknowledged; `@coderabbitai review` → 02:16 «No actionable comments were generated in the recent review» over `ad131dc..087cb54`, check pass. **Goal reached (owner 01:36): no CodeRabbit remarks, the PR waits for a maintainer.** Replies: `qa_runs/pr-simulator-windows/replies-round1.md`.
  3. The reader card holds debug8 + debug7 + 1.1.2 (`/.firmware/`); the owner runs debug8.
- **Open work, in order:**
  1. **Bug 01 PR** `pr/library-tab-fit` (`d2b45c0e`, `d0c99508`) — waits for a free upstream slot (5/5 open) and the
     owner's proofreading of the PR text.
  2. **Debug line**: `wip/krinik-debug8` (`c072214b`, local in `firmware/`, not pushed) = 1.1.1-debug6 + bugs 03/04 +
     idea 01. BACKLOG: merge release 1.1.2 (`198d385e`) into the debug line (conflicts in `lib/hal/HalFrontlight.{cpp,h}`,
     `test/frontlight_dither/`), then `1.1.2-debugN`. The owner's open choice: the light-linger hold (400 ms) vs the
     timer-redraw hold (≈ reset-to-sample) rules differ.
  3. `bugs/05` — simulator on Windows: the firmware closes its UDP discovery socket with `close()`; found by reading,
     not reproduced. Also open, upstream-side: socket handle inheritance into curl (judge note, PR #62 research).
  4. Owner's open questions: proofread `GOAL.md`.
  5. Delete the partial `C:\msys64` left by the killed 2026-11-09 14:44 install (KAGO said it is safe) — check the
     machine lock first.
- **Rules born this chat** (all in `AGENT_GUIDE.md`): reviewer bots can be wrong — trace a finding in code before
  acting; after a code change an independent judge first, build after; a PR description carries no AI-participation
  line and nothing sent out carries AI authorship (no `Co-Authored-By` trailer on pushed commits).
- KNOWLEDGE: Windows UCRT `TZ` — three-letter names only, DST on US dates (simulator README, research 01); Winsock
  sockets cannot be `dup()`-ed and `_execvp` does not replace the process (research 01); `MoveFileEx` for an
  overwrite-safe replace; lessons EXP-0008…0010 (`EXPERIENCE.md`): Git Bash grep crashes on long pipes, a "defect" that
  was my script quitting first, parallel shell calls must not rely on `cd`.

## Language contract

- Documents the agent reads (this file, plans, researches, code comments, commit messages) — **English**.
- Every word to the owner — chat, questions, reports — **Russian**.
- Interviews for the owner and owner-facing documents — **Russian**.
- Files under `legacy/` and older `researches/`, `interviews/`, `qa_runs/` notes are Russian; they are an archive, translate only
  what an active task needs.

## START HERE — Task 0: bring the project up on the owner's PC and deploy KAIF 2.9 + 2.10 WIP

This is the first and only task until it is closed. Do it in order; each step has an exit you can check.

1. **Clone the workspace.**
   - [x] `git clone https://github.com/MikalaiKryvusha/Krinik-Custom-CrossPoint.git` into the owner's chosen folder.
   - [x] Inside it, clone the firmware fork with its SDK submodule (it is ignored by this repo's `.gitignore`):
     `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MikalaiKryvusha/crosspoint-reader.git firmware`,
     then `git -C firmware remote add upstream https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader.git`.
   - [ ] Clone KEINKT beside it if calibration work is planned: `https://github.com/MikalaiKryvusha/KEINKT.git` (separate project,
     its own STATUS).
   - Exit: `git -C firmware branch -r` lists `origin/wip/krinik-debug5` and `origin/release/krinik-1.1.2`.

2. **Restore the toolchain.** The laptop was macOS; the PC may not be — adapt, do not copy paths.
   - [ ] Python 3 + PlatformIO Core (a venv inside the workspace, ignored by git), Node.js ≥ 20, CMake for host tests, `gh` logged in
     as MikalaiKryvusha.
   - [ ] Build check on `wip/krinik-debug5`: `pio run -e x4pro-krinik-debug` → SUCCESS, image ≈ 5.4 MB.
   - [ ] Host tests: configure `firmware/test` with CMake, build, `ctest` (run serially if `ParserStopTest` flakes under `-j`;
     the last laptop run was 936/936).
   - [ ] Simulator: `pio run -e simulator_x4_pro` builds and opens.
   - Exit: the three commands above pass; record versions of PlatformIO, Node, CMake in the closing report.

3. **Deploy KAIF from `main` (2.9 release + 2.10 WIP).**
   - [x] Download the entry file into the workspace root:
     `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikalaiKryvusha/KAIF/main/KAIF.md -o KAIF.md`.
   - [x] Run it with the owner's phrasing: **"Deploy KAIF from KAIF.md, my working language is Russian"** — payload English,
     owner-facing documents Russian, tracking to the origin.
   - [x] Record the exact KAIF commit SHA that was installed (`main` moves daily; 2.10 is unreleased). If the 2.10 WIP installer
     fails, report the failure upstream (KAIF field report, see step 5) and fall back to the `v2.9` tag:
     `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikalaiKryvusha/KAIF/v2.9/KAIF.md`.
   - [x] `GOAL.md` comes from the owner, not from the agent: KAIF asks for it after the install — run that as a Russian interview.
   - Exit: `.kaif/kaif.json` exists with the version and origin; the KAIF self-check of the install summary is green.

4. **Adapt the legacy material into the KAIF canon** (KAIF's own adaptation task drives this; the inputs are below).
   - [ ] The backlog below and `legacy/STATUS.ru.md` + the head of `legacy/HANDOVER.ru.md` → the new `STATUS.md` backlog, in English.
   - [ ] `legacy/PROJECT_HISTORY.ru.md` → `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` (archive, may stay Russian, mark it so).
   - [ ] `legacy/README.ru.md` is the device setup guide (`restore.mjs`, fonts, settings) → the owner-facing README section,
     Russian; the agent-facing parts in English.
   - [ ] Lessons scattered in the legacy docs (flaky `ctest -j`, `pio run -e x4pro` wiping the simulator binary, SD-only flashing
     because the reader is eFuse-locked, the 5-open-PR limit upstream) → `EXPERIENCE.md` entries.
   - Exit: no active rule lives only in `legacy/`; `legacy/` is referenced as archive.

5. **Owner decisions — via a Russian interview, never decided by the agent.**
   - [ ] What happens to the private bulk that stayed on the laptop (see "Left on the laptop").
   - [ ] Whether `wip/krinik-debug5` becomes the next krinik release line.
   - KAIF defects found during the install go upstream by KAIF's own field-report route; they contain nothing personal beyond
     what is already public here.

6. **Close Task 0.**
   - [ ] Commit and push; the closing report (Russian) names the KAIF SHA, toolchain versions, build/test results.
   - [ ] Tell the owner the laptop can now clone this repo. `~/Xteink` on the laptop is retired only on the owner's word, after a
     by-name check that everything listed in `legacy/left-on-laptop.tsv` is either moved or knowingly dropped.

## Next after Task 0 — rename the firmware krinik → KCCP

Owner, 2026-11-08: the custom firmware is renamed from **krinik** to **KCCP** (Krinik Custom CrossPoint). Docs of this repo
already say KCCP. In the firmware fork it is still krinik:
- [ ] version string `2.0.0-krinik…` → `…-kccp…` (the OTA check compares the CrossPoint part — keep it working), env names
  `x4pro-krinik*` / `simulator_x4_pro_mama`, on-device strings, the fork README, the Russian guide `РУКОВОДСТВО.epub`;
- [ ] next releases and tags as `kccp-<version>`; released `krinik-*` tags, branch names and image file names stay as history;
- [ ] build, host tests, simulator, then the owner checks on the reader before any release.

## Carry-over backlog (state on 2026-11-08, from the laptop)

### Upstream contributions to crosspoint-reader

- Open PRs (all 14/14 checks green on 2026-11-07, all waiting for maintainer review): #4328 `pr/epub-anchor-first-line`,
  #4332 `pr/sleep-image-order`, #4375 `pr/screen-clean-menu`, #4376 `pr/screen-redraw-delay` (depends on #4375),
  #4377 `pr/screen-calibration` (calibration with KEINKT; reconcile overlaps with #4375 when it lands).
- Merged: #4329, #4330, #4331.
- Upstream allows five open PRs per author. Do not close PRs to free a slot.
- Ready locally, waiting for a free slot: **04** `pr/screen-clean-return` (text already proofread by the owner) — send command at
  the end of `qa_runs/prs-2026-11-06/SEND_WHEN_READY.md`.
- Ready, texts waiting for the owner's proofreading: **11** `pr/night-epub-images` (584c04e0), **12** `pr/lyra-title-lines`
  (9d8bd77e), **13** `pr/viewer-reader-controls` (636126c5), **14** `pr/sleep-skip-truncated-bmp` (5977ce1e). Bodies:
  `qa_runs/prs-2026-11-07-batch2/bodies/`; queue: `qa_runs/prs-2026-11-06/queue.json`. Builds and before/after frames were made on
  those HEADs — do not rewrite the branches without a reason.
- Two issue drafts for `lib/hal/` changes (upstream wants agreement first), unpublished, waiting for proofreading:
  `qa_runs/prs-2026-11-07-batch2/issue-frontlight-park-before-sleep.md`, `issue-fat-dates-from-clock.md`.
- Rule: no PR or issue text goes out without the owner's proofreading. Candidate analysis:
  `researches/2026-11-08_krinik_upstream_candidates_batch2.md`.

### Device (Xteink X4 Pro, eFuse-locked: firmware only from the SD card)

- Last install confirmed by the owner: **krinik 1.1.1-debug5** (owner, 2026-11-08: precise temperature and the Home "Sleep" item are
  done and tested on the reader).
- [ ] Precise temperature rework (owner, 2026-11-08): dithering only at brightness **≤ 9 %**, off at **10 %** (now it runs up to the
  duty of 10 %).
- Battery log every 20 min is a **DEBUG ONLY** aid — keep it out of release builds.
- Debug line: debug3 (precise temperature), debug4 (battery log tick every 20 min), debug5 (= debug4 + "Sleep" item in the Home
  menu under "Flashlight"). Images and SHA256 in `firmware-builds/`; evidence in
  `qa_runs/precise-temperature-2026-11-06/`, `qa_runs/debug4-2026-11-06/`, `qa_runs/debug5-sleep-menu-2026-11-06/`.
- The debug2–5 code was uncommitted on the laptop; it is now `wip/krinik-debug5` in both forks (see the code map). The debug2 image
  itself is in `firmware-builds/` (`cp-2.0.0-krinik-1.1.1-debug2.bin`).
- **KCCP 1.1.2** (frontlight) is published: https://github.com/MikalaiKryvusha/Krinik-Custom-CrossPoint/releases/tag/kccp-1.1.2 (2026-11-08,
  bilingual notes, Latest; the image still says `cp-2.0.0-krinik-1.1.2` inside).
- "Mama" build with OPDS/plugins: the Home menu has 8 rows and the "Mama" row runs off the screen — fix before the next mama build.

### Hardware research

- Closed 2026-11-08: no charging cut-off (needs a board modification); the charger analysis and the battery/light
  measurements moved verbatim to `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` (entry 2026-11-09, STATUS trim).
- LED driver/current/ratings still unknown; UI 80 % on the log scale ≈ 21.4 % duty, not 80 % current.

### Future (owner, 2026-11-06: "on the future")

- Configurable Control Center tiles in a separate menu (add Sleep/Flashlight, hide Bluetooth/Clean). Recon:
  `src/activities/util/FrontlightPanelActivity.*`, `kTileCount`, `runTile(idx)`, `buildPanelScreen`.

## Code map — where the code lives

**Rule (owner, 2026-11-08):** the fork `MikalaiKryvusha/crosspoint-reader` exists only to send pull requests to upstream `develop` — keep it
clean. KCCP releases live in **this repo** (all of them: `kccp-1.1.2` and the historical `krinik-*` / `v2.0.0-krinik.1`).
- [ ] Owner decision (Russian interview on the PC): where the KCCP firmware branches (`nikolai`, `release/*`, `wip/*`, `pr-assets`) live
  instead of the fork, then move them and leave the fork with `develop` and `pr/*` only.

The firmware code is not in this repo; it is in the owner's public forks.

## What is in this repo

- `restore.mjs`, `settings.json`, `fonts/`, `РУКОВОДСТВО.epub`, `КАЛИБРОВКА.epub`, `covers/`, `guide_settings_section.xhtml` —
  the owner's reader setup (how-to in `legacy/README.ru.md`).
- `firmware-builds/` — own krinik images with SHA256 files (sources in the forks above).
- `tools/` — font build, image and analysis scripts. `kuips-runner/` — `npm install` restores it.
- `researches/`, `research/`, `interviews/` — analyses and owner interviews (Russian).
- `qa_runs/` — evidence of builds, tests, PR preparation (logs, diffs, frames), filtered for publication.
- `sleep/` — sleep-screen previews; the BMP files themselves stayed on the laptop.
- `legacy/` — the laptop-era README, STATUS, HANDOVER, PROJECT_HISTORY (Russian) and `left-on-laptop.tsv`.

## Left on the laptop — not published

Moved verbatim to `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` (entry 2026-11-08, "Left on the laptop") on 2026-11-09; per-file list in
`legacy/left-on-laptop.tsv`.
